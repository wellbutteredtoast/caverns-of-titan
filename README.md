Caverns of Titan is a dungeon-crawling, difficult metroidvania-like game all about exploring a huge system of caverns that meander all through the underground of Saturn's mysterious Titan. Underneath the oceans, the dense ice, everything... you dwell on - or under - the surface of it all. Why? I'm not 100% sure as of yet. Your goal is simple, you explore the caverns, taking out whatever hostile life you come across, collect samples of whatever you can recover, and see how deep down you can go. There are a handful of enemies, lifeforms, and areas to explore. Nothing too major since this is a game jam submission, but if this project is well recieved I may do more work on it and give it a proper release onto itch.io.

This project was **originally started** the [Metroidvania Month 28](https://itch.io/jam/metroidvania-month-28) game jam! As of May 20, 2025, this project has been pulled out of the game jam and is now more of a personal project.

## Tools of the Trade

> **[Aesprite](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite)** is my art tool of choice, it's easy and works amazing.

> **[LMMS](https://lmms.io/)** is my goto music production tool, I don't use FL (b/c I am broke), and free is always good.

> **[rFXGen](https://raylibtech.itch.io/rfxgen)** is how I make SFX, it's very cool.

## Releases

> [!WARNING]
> Caverns of Titan may not properly work on platforms not listed!

I intend to release this game on **three** major platforms;
 - Windows (x64 / arm64)
 - MacOS (arm64)
 - Linux (x64 / arm64)

For all builds that are not listed here, running `cargo build --release` or `cargo run` should allow you to compile and play on your native system. As long as you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed properly. I will not be providing instructions for systems like web builds or niche architectures such as **Itanium** and **RISC-V.**
